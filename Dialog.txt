DRIVER - Alexa, what's the best moment to put gas to the car?

ALEXA - I have looked at your Calendar. I've explored the cheapest fuel stations
        and detected that the best choice is to refuel tomorrow before you go to
        Hackaton Mobility in a gas station located 100 meters from the meeting.
        I will alert you tomorrow.
